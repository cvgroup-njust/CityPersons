This repo provides bounding box annotations, python evaluation code, and a benchmark for CityPersons, which is a subset of the [Cityscapes dataset](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/).
Please download the images from the Cityscapes website!

Welcome to join the competition by submitting your results on the test set!
